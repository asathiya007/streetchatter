# StreetChatter

StreetChatter is an AI that assumes the role of Street Fighter characters (e.g. Ryu, Dhalsim, Chun-Li, M. Bison, Ken) and chats with users to help them learn the lore of that character and the Street Fighter universe. StreetChatter is powered by an LLM (Llama-3.3-70b-instruct) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

To see how StreetChatter works, see the `streetchatter.py` file and the `streetchatter.ipynb` notebook (which showcases a chat with Ryu, the main character of the Street Fighter games!).
